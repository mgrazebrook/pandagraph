# pandagraph
From data frame to GraphQL API in 2 lines of code

Pandagraph is a Python library which introspects a Pandas database, uses that information to build 
a GraphQL API and exposes it through Flask.

We include a demo, a AngularJS application which uses the GraphQL to create several charts in a dashboard.
